'Homework Easy
'Instructions

'Create a script that will loop through each year of stock data and grab the total amount of volume each stock had over the year.
'You will also need to display the ticker symbol to coincide with the total volume.
'Your result should look as follows (note: all solution images are for 2015 data).


'SOLUTION

Sub tickerloop()

'Set a variable for holding the ticker name
        Dim tickername As String
        
'Set a varable for holding a total count on the total volume of trade
        Dim tickervolume As Double
        tickervolume = 0
        
'Set the location for each ticker name in the summary table
        Dim summary_ticker_row As Integer
        summary_ticker_row = 2
        
'Label the Summary Table headers
        Cells(1, 9).Value = "Ticker"
        Cells(1, 10).Value = "Total Stock Volume"
        
'Count the number of rows in the first column.
        lastrow = Cells(Rows.Count, 1).End(xlUp).Row
        
'Loop through the rows by the ticker names
'All the ticker names are sorted and are alpha-numeric/string variables.
'Perform a manual check

        For i = 2 To lastrow
'Searches for when the value of the next cell is different than that of the current cell
        If Cells(i + 1, 1).Value <> Cells(i, 1).Value Then
            
'Set the ticker name
        tickername = Cells(i, 1).Value
'Add the volume of trade
        tickervolume = tickervolume + Cells(i, 7).Value
        
'Print the ticker name in the summary table
        Range("I" & summary_ticker_row).Value = tickername
        
'Print the trade volume for each ticker in the summary table
        Range("J" & summary_ticker_row).Value = tickervolume
        
'Add one to the summary_ticker_row
        summary_ticker_row = summary_ticker_row + 1
        
'Reset tickervolume to zero
        tickervolume = 0
        
         Else
              
'Now add the volume of trade
        tickervolume = tickervolume + Cells(i, 7).Value

        End If
        
        Next i
        
                

End Sub
